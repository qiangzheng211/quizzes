Minesweeper is a contemporary of many other popular early computer games, 
like solitaire, free cell, chess, and others. 

How to play: 
There are invisible mines planted on a 30 x 30 square grid. Your mission, 
should you choose to accept it, is to cover as much territory without 
getting blown up. 
 
Click into the minefield to expose free space. The numbers show how many
bombs are adjacent to that square. Use your math skills and powers of 
deduction to identify where the bombs must be. Place a flag where you 
know a bomb to be.

colleagues will handle the graphic representation of the game. 

Complete the Board.java and BoardTest.java files to control responses to
actions in the game. All tests should execute successfully.
